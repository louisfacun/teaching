# Activity 3 - Review of Intelligent Assistants
In this activity, we'll review the basic concepts of `Intelligent Assistants`. This is important since I'll require you to have your own assistants as `midterm project`.

# What to Do
In intelligent assistants or virtual assistants:
1. Discuss what is `trigger word or wake word` and give 1 example. (5 points)
2. Discuss what is `commands` and give 3 examples. (5 points)
3. Research the difference between `speech recognition` and `voice recognition`. Give examples. (10 points).

# When to Do It
Before next week class.

# Notes
- For question 1, 2 and 3, avoid copy-pasting from the internet, especially from your classmates.
- Follow general instructions, submit `DOC` or `PDF` only. Do not submit images such as `JPG`.

# Advice
- For question 1 and 2, remember what we are programming in our laboratory schedule, OR you can research.
- For question 3, avoid very long answers, short sentences are enough. But clear and concise answers are important.
- If you have any questions, you can private message me at Facebook.
