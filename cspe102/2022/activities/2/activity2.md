# When to Do It
Before next week class.

# Advice
- Recommender systems are examples of intelligent systems where it will try to suggest relevant information to the users.
- Follow the examples in week 2 lecture/modules (found in [week2-lesson2.pdf](https://github.com/louisfacun/teaching/raw/master/cspe102/2022/modules/week2/week2-lesson2.pdf)).
- Don't use `Lazada`, `Facebook` and `YouTube`.
- Think of similar websites like social media sites, e-commerce sites, and video sharing sites.

# Example: 
1. Company/website: ```Lazada```
   - `input`: a user clicked or liked an item.
   - `output`: recommend similar item at the homepage.

2. Company/website: ```YouTube```
   - `input`: a user watched or liked an video.
   - `output`: recommend similar videos at the right side video lists and/or homepage.
