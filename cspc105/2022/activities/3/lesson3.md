# Activity 3 - Alphabets, Strings and Language Application Practice
5 points each

# What to Do
1. Give five (5) strings (w) that can be derived from the given alphabet `Î£`: 

   $$ \Sigma = \lbrace a, b, c \rbrace$$

   *YOUR ANSWER:*

   $$ w = ? $$

   $$ w = ? $$

   $$ w = ? $$
   
   $$ w = ? $$
   
   $$ w = ? $$

2. Given by two `w` strings:
   
   $$ a = automata $$
   
   $$ b = theory $$

   What is `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb` (concatenation).

   *YOUR ANSWER:*
   
   $$ aa = ? $$
   
   $$ ab = ? $$
   
   $$ ba = ? $$
   
   $$ bb = ? $$

3. Write the language to atleast 5 members defined with the `Language notation`:
   
   $$ L = \lbrace ab^k | k \geq 3 \rbrace $$

   *YOUR ANSWER:* 

   $$ L = \lbrace ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ... \rbrace $$

4. Provide the `Language notation` for the given language `L`:
   
   $$ L = \lbrace xy, xyy, xyyy, xyyyy, ... \rbrace$$ 

   *YOUR ANSWER:*

   $$ L = \lbrace ? | ? \rbrace $$
