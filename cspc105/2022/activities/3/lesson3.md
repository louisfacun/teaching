# Activity 3 - Alphabets, Strings and Language Application Practice
5 points each

# What to Do
1. Give five (5) strings (w) that can be derived from the given alphabet `Î£`: 

   $$ \Sigma = \{a, b, c\}$$

   *YOUR ANSWER:*
   $$ w = ? $$
   $$ w = ? $$
   $$ w = ? $$
   $$ w = ? $$
   $$ w = ? $$

2. Given by two `w` strings:
   $$ a = automata $$
   $$ b = theory $$

   What is `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb` (concatenation).

   *YOUR ANSWER:*
   $$ aa = ? $$
   $$ ab = ? $$
   $$ ba = ? $$
   $$ bb = ? $$

3. Write the language to atleast 5 members defined with the `Language notation`:
   $$ L = \{ab^k | k \geq 3 \} $$
   *YOUR ANSWER:* 
   $$ L = \{ ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ...\} $$

4. Provide the `Language notation` for the given language `L`:
   $$ L = \{xy, xyy, xyyy, xyyyy, ...\}$$ 

   *YOUR ANSWER:*
   $$ L = \{ ? | ? \} $$
