# Lesson 3 - Alphabets, Strings and Languages
## **Alphabets**
`Alphabet` is a non-empty finite set of symbols.

For example:
$$ \Sigma_{1} = \{0, 1\} $$
That is an example of alphabet with two symbols (an alphabet of `binary numbers`).

2nd example:
$$ \Sigma_{2} = \{a, b, c, ... , x, y, z \} $$
That is an example of alphabet with 26 symbols (an alphabet of `English alphabet`).

3rd example:
$$ \Sigma_{3} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \} $$
That is an example of alphabet with ten symbols (an alphabet of `decimal numbers`).

## **Strings**
`String` is a finite sequence of symbols from an alphabet.

Let an alphabet:
$$ \Sigma_{1} = \{0, 1\} $$

Therefore, the strings *0*, *1* and *001* are examples of string over the alphabet above. We can also write strings as `w`. For example:
$$ w = 0 $$
$$ w = 1 $$
$$ w = 001 $$

Another example, let an alphabet:
$$ \Sigma_{2} = \{a, b\} $$

Thus, the following are strings from the second alphabet above:

$$ w = a $$
$$ w = ab $$ 
$$ w = baa $$

### **Length of string or cardinality**
`Length of string or cardinality` is the number of symbols in a string.

For example:
$$ w = abcd $$

The length of the string `w` is 4, since it has 4 symbols: *a, b, c, d*. We can also denote the length of string using character `|w|`:
$$ |w| = 4 $$

### **Empty string**
`Empty string` is a string that contains no symbols. In this course, we denote it with `Î»` (lambda) symbol. Of course, `empty string` has a length of 0:
$$ | \lambda | = 0$$

### **Concatenation**
`Concatentation` combines two strings. If we have string `x` and `y` then, their concatenation is denoted by `xy`, it is the string formed by appending string `y` to `x`. For example, say we have two strings:
$$ x = louis $$
$$ y = facun $$

Therefore `xy` is:
$$ xy = louisfacun $$
Reversely, `yx` is:
$$ yx = facunlouis $$

If we concatenate an empty string some string, then that string won't change. For example:
$$ x\lambda = x$$

### **Substring**
A string `x` is a `substring` of some string `y` if the string `x` appears `consecutively` in string `y`.

For example:
$$ y = banana $$
$$ x = nana $$
The string `nana` appears consecutively in the string `banana`. Thus, the string `x` is a substring of string `y`. But the string `nab` is *not* a substring of `y`.

### **Suffix and prefix**
A string `x` is a `suffix` of `y` if it is a substring of `y` while also appearing in the end of `y`. For example:

$$ y = banana $$
$$ x = nana $$
The `x` is a substring of `y` and it also appears at the end of `y`. Thus, `x` is a `prefix` of `y`. 
Similarly, it is a substring but it appears at the `start`, then it is called a `suffix`. For example:
$$ y = banana $$
$$ z = bana $$
In this case, the string `z` or `bana` is a substring of `y` and also appears at the start. Therefore `z` is a `prefix` of `y`.

### **`k` copies of `w`**
$$ w^k$$

Represents the concatenation of string `w`, `k` times. For example:.
$$ w = ab $$

If `k` is equal to 1, then the string `w` is concatenated 1 time:
$$ w^1 = ab $$
If `k` is equal to 2, then:
$$ w^2 = abab $$
And so on:
$$ w^3 = ababab $$
$$ w^4 = abababab $$

## **Languages**
`Language (L)` is a set of all possible strings from an alphabet, given a condition.

For example, given an alphabet:
$$ \Sigma = \{0, 1\} $$
With a condition: `No two consecutive 1s`, then, the language is:
$$ L = \{\lambda, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 000, 001, 010, 100, ...\} $$

Note that, we also included `empty string` since this is also a `possible string`. Also, in the set, we won't put strings such as: `11`, `011`, `110`, `111` and so on, since all these strings contains two consecutives `1s`.

### Language notation
Most of the time it would be use to use `set notation` to define a language instead of tediously writing it.

$$ w = ab $$
Say, you have language:
$$ L = \{ab, abab, ababab, abababab, ...\} $$
We can simply say using notation:
$$ L = \{w^k | k \geq 1 \} $$

L is k copies of w such that k is greater than or equal to 1.
