# Lesson 3 - Alphabets, Strings and Languages
## Alphabets
`Alphabet` is a non-empty finite set of symbols.

For example:
$$ \Sigma_{1} = \{0, 1\} $$
That is an example of alphabet with two symbols (an alphabet of `binary numbers`).

2nd example:
$$ \Sigma_{2} = \{a, b, c, ... , x, y, z \} $$
That is an example of alphabet with 26 symbols (an alphabet of `English alphabet`).

3rd example:
$$ \Sigma_{3} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \} $$
That is an example of alphabet with ten symbols (an alphabet of `decimal numbers`).

## Strings
`String` is a finite sequence of symbols from an alphabet.

Let an alphabet:
$$ \Sigma_{1} = \{0, 1\} $$

Therefore, the strings *0*, *1* and *001* are examples of string over the alphabet above. We can also write strings as `w`. For example:
$$ w = 0 $$
$$ w = 1 $$
$$ w = 001 $$

Another example, let an alphabet:
$$ \Sigma_{2} = \{a, b\} $$

Thus, the following are strings from the second alphabet above:

$$ w = a $$
$$ w = ab $$ 
$$ w = baa $$

### Length of string or cardinality
`Length of string or cardinality` is the number of symbols in a string.

For example:
$$ w = abcd $$

The length of the string `w` is 4, since it has 4 symbols: *a, b, c, d*. We can also denote the length of string using character `|w|`:
$$ |w| = 4 $$
